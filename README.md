##Greg Rucka Author Information Site
####Version 2

A second version of the author informational site for Greg Rucka. With the help of friends, I was able to make several edits to this version that enhanced the readability and overall look for the better. 

**Body:** I removed the border around all of the content and adjusted the margin borders. I also gave the background a hint of grey so it wasn't as stark white.

***Accent lines:** Added 100% to the width so it would resize with the screen. Also replaced the second set of accent lines with a horizontal rule.

**Author Bio:** Added line-height to the author bio for better readability. Also removed the fancy quote from the blockquote and placed it in its own div. Decreased the border size for the image and set the max-width/height to 100% so it would resize with the screen.

**Selected Works:** Added "directions" so the user knows the lists are links and adjusted the line-height for better reading. 

**Social Media:** Moved this area to outside the container and allowed for it to scroll with the page. Also adjusted the box sizing and margins so it would not overlap the footer link.

**Links:** Changed the hover color from a light grey to a muted blue. 

**Footer:** Underlined the link for the author's official site and added padding to top and bottom.
